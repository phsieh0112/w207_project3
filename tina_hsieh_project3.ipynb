    "---\n",
    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively **dense** (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively **sparse** (represented as a **bag-of-words**). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "1. Comment your code.\n",
    "1. All graphs should have titles, label for each axis, and if needed a legend. It should be understandable on its own.\n",
    "1. All code must run on colab.research.google.com\n",
    "1. You should not import any additional libraries.\n",

    "- Q5: KNN algorithm is used to classify by defining the k nearest matches in training data and then using the label of closet matches to predict. It is very susceptible to the curse of dimensionality. In a high-dimentional space, the feature space becomes very sparse with an increase of features, and that makes the closet neightbors be too far away. That makes the model not work well for this problem. \n",
    "<br>\n",

    "- Q6: Normally, it depends on the dataset. For this problem, logistic regression model does not perform better than the Naive Bayes model. It could be because logistic regression models are more sensitive to outliers, and there are more outliers in this problem. Or another hypothesis is that the features (vocabularies) in this problem do not violate the independence assumption that much.\n",

    "### Question 6: L1 and L2 regularization\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, **L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features**. For this reason, we can use it as a way to do \"feature selection\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For several L1 regularization strengths ...\n",
    "  1. Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.\n",
    "  1. Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary . For this new model, use an **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  \n",
    "  1. Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "1. Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "1. How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* No need to apply pre-processing from question 5.\n",
    "* Train on the transformed (i.e. CountVectorizer) training data.\n",
    "* Evaluate on the transformed development data (using the CountVectorizer instance you trained on the training data).\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l1\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L1 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001).\n",
    "* (solver=\"liblinear\" might be needed for it not to crash)"

    "- Q1: CountVectorizer counts the frequency of a word in documents. Because it's based on word frequency, the model might miss some rare but critical words that do not apprear often. It also does not identify the relationships between words such as linguistic similarity between words. On the other hand, TfidVectorizer is based on the frequency of a word in the corpus but it also provides a numerical representation of how important a word is for statistical analysis.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q3: The R ratio considers the maximum probability and the probability of correct label. If the model predicts correctly, the R ratio would be zero. If the model assigns a topic with a low probability and it turns out to be correct, the R ratio becomes large. Basically, R ratio indicates how far the model is in predicting the true label.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q4: For the first two documents, it is clear that the contents are related to the religion topic with \"Mormon\" mentioned. However, there are several computer related terms, e.g., ftp, ASCII and dba. That might make the model think they are related to the graphic variable. One fix I can think of is to increase the frequency of topic-specific keywards, like \"Mormon\", \"lone\", \"seconds\" and \"bullet\" in this case."
